# Support

Thank you for using projects maintained by our organization. Support is
provided on a voluntary basis by a solo contributor with zero budget—your
contributions of knowledge, bug reports, and fixes are highly appreciated.

## Support Channels

- **GitHub Issues**
  Open a new issue in the relevant repository using the appropriate template:
  - Bug: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml`
  - Feature: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.yml`

- **GitHub Discussions** (if enabled)
  Use Discussions for conceptual questions, best practices, or general
  community chat.

- **Email Support**
  For non-sensitive or longer-form inquiries, email [**support@williaby.com**](mailto:support@williaby.com).

## Before Submitting an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** to see if your question has already been asked.
2. **Check documentation** (README, project docs) for potential answers.
3. **Gather details**: project version, environment, reproduction steps, logs,
                        and screenshots if applicable.

## Supported Versions

Support is typically provided only for actively maintained releases.
Consult the [Supported Versions](SECURITY.md#supported-versions) section for
details on which versions are in scope.

## Response Expectations

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 5 business days
- **Resolution:** Urgent issues addressed within 14 business days; non-urgent
                   inquiries handled when capacity allows

## Community Contributions

We welcome and encourage contributions to improve our support processes.
