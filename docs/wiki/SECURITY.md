# Security & Privacy

LedgerBase handles sensitive financial data, so we follow best practices to protect user information. Below is an overview of how we address security throughout the application.

---

## 1. Credentials & Environment Variables

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Store secrets (e.g., Plaid API keys, database credentials) in a secure `.env` file **not** committed to source control.
   - Avoid hard-coding credentials in code or configuration files.
   - Update the `.gitignore` to ensure no `.env` file is ever pushed to GitHub.

2. **Key Rotation**
   - Rotate API keys periodically, especially if you suspect unauthorized access or credentials leaks.

---

## 2. Secure Data Storage

1. **Database Encryption**
   - Use a database that supports encryption at rest (like PostgreSQL with disk encryption) and ensure backups are also encrypted.
   - Consider field-level encryption for highly sensitive data, if applicable.

2. **Access Controls**
   - Restrict DB access to only essential network paths (e.g., inside a Docker network or local environment).
   - Grant “least privilege” database roles so the application can only perform necessary queries.

## 3. Application Security

1. **Transport Layer Security (TLS/HTTPS)**
   - Enforce HTTPS in production to protect data in transit.
   - Use secure cookies and set `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` attributes in your Flask (or equivalent) sessions.

2. **Secure Session Management**
   - Implement strong session tokens with a random `SECRET_KEY`.
   - Expire sessions after a reasonable period of inactivity.

3. **Validation & Sanitization**
   - Validate all user input, especially when dealing with transactions or vendor data.
   - Use parameterized queries or ORM methods to prevent SQL injection.

---

## 4. Authentication & Authorization

1. **Role-Based Access**
   - Provide different user roles (e.g., Admin, Standard User) as needed.
   - Ensure each route checks for the correct role permissions.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** *(optional)*
   - Consider offering MFA for users to reduce unauthorized access.

---

## 5. Ongoing Monitoring & Audits

1. **Logging & Audit Trails**
   - Record significant actions (e.g., vendor matching, large transaction imports, account modifications).
   - Store logs securely and monitor them for suspicious behavior.

2. **Dependency Scanning**
   - Regularly update dependencies (Python packages, Docker images, etc.).
   - Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` to identify known vulnerabilities in Python libraries.

3. **Security Patches**
   - Subscribe to security advisories for your OS, framework, and dependencies.
   - Patch critical vulnerabilities as soon as possible.

---

## 6. Incident Response

- **Policy**: Create a simple process for responding to security incidents:
  1. Contain the breach (revoke credentials, isolate affected components).
  2. Investigate logs and impacted accounts.
  3. Notify users if data might be compromised.
  4. Update patches and keys accordingly.
