## Notes

- Savings-based budgets accumulate unused amounts instead of resetting
- Business expenses are tagged and exported per user for reimbursement
- Reimbursement reports should include vendor, total, transaction count, and date range
- Savings logic must validate that account balances support cumulative allocations
