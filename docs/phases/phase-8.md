## Notes

- Final UI should use Bootstrap 5 (or similar) with dark mode option
- Dashboard can include cards for:
  - Unmatched vendors
  - Over-budget categories
  - Savings shortfalls
- `.env` and volume configs must follow secure best practices
- QA testing will validate real-world workflows with sample data and regressions
