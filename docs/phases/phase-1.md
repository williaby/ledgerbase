## Notes

- This milestone focuses on automation and core ingestion pipelines.
- All services are expected to be containerized and managed via Docker Compose.
- Flask is stubbed in this phase and will be expanded in Phase 2.
- Schema and token management must follow `.env`-driven configuration with no sensitive values committed.
