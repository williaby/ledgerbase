## Notes

- Budgets should clone automatically month-to-month unless manually changed
- Each entry includes `category_level1`, `category_level2`, `amount`, and `rollover` flag
- Transaction filtering for comparison must exclude transfers and income
- Person tagging helps explain outliers or special expenses within family categories
