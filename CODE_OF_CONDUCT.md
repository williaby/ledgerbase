We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in this
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless
of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

     or advances

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
